Welcome to the SS Titan Foundation - home of the proposed world's largest ocean liner - Titan.

Founded in 2008, our organization looks to pay tribute to the great floating palaces of the early 20th century, most notably the infamous RMS Titanic with her design and interiors, while honoring all of those involved with her legacy, and forever remembering those lost.

Our mission is to bring Titan to the world as the Ship of Ages, a vessel of light and hope for many of the world's sick and needy children, and through her, make a lasting and positive impact on their lives.

Thank you for visiting us, we appreciate your support, and we hope you'll help spread the word ...
